To deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, you'll need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application. Be sure to use the following guides for support:

  * [Set Up MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Setup.md)

  * [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md)
